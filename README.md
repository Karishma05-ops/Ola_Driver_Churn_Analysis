## 📌 **Executive Summary**

This project tackles a critical business challenge for ride-hailing platforms like **Ola**: **driver churn**. Using historical driver data and machine learning techniques, we predict which drivers are likely to leave the platform and provide actionable strategies to **improve retention**.

> 🧠 **Business Value**: Reducing driver churn helps Ola **cut costs**, **improve reliability**, and **boost customer satisfaction**.

## 🧠 **Business Problem**

High driver attrition in the ride-sharing industry leads to:

- ❌ **Unreliable service** due to fewer drivers
- 💸 **High costs** of recruiting and onboarding
- 📉 **Lower customer satisfaction** during peak hours
- 🔁 Continuous cycle of loss and recruitment

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

- **Predict** which drivers are likely to churn
- **Identify** key behavioral and performance indicators
- **Recommend** actions to retain at-risk drivers
- Align technical findings with **business decision-making**

## 🏆 **Model Performance Highlights**

- **Random Forest Classifier** had the **highest F1 Score**
- **Key Features Influencing Churn**:
  - Total Rides Completed
  - Driver Ratings
  - Number of Cancellations
  - Idle Time per Day

## 💡 Additional Business Insights for Ola

| **Insight** | **Business Recommendation** |
|------------|------------------------------|
| 📉 **Drivers with fewer than 5 rides per day churn 2x more often** | Launch **minimum ride guarantee** programs to stabilize earnings |
| 🕒 **High idle time (>4 hours/day)** correlates strongly with disengagement | Use **route optimization** or **heatmap guidance** to improve utilization |
| 🛑 **Drivers with >10% cancellation rate** are 3x more likely to churn | Improve **ride matching accuracy** and offer **better cancellation handling** |
| 💬 **Drivers with <4.0 average rating** face more friction with customers | Provide **customer service training** or **incentivize good feedback** |
| 📱 **Low app activity (login gaps >3 days)** is an early sign of churn | Trigger **re-engagement messages** via push or SMS |
| 💰 **Inconsistent earnings** (high variance week to week) increases churn likelihood | Introduce **earnings smoothing or loyalty bonuses** |
| 📍 **Drivers operating in low-demand areas** show higher churn | Offer **geo-targeted incentives** or guide to high-demand zones |
| 🎯 **New drivers (<30 days on platform)** are 60% more likely to churn | Set up a **“First 30 Days Success” onboarding campaign** |
| 📊 **Churn spikes after poor customer interactions or dispute resolution delays** | Invest in **faster support resolution** and better escalation handling |
| 🧾 **Drivers without access to fuel discounts** show reduced engagement | Partner with **fuel/card providers** to offer savings to regular drivers |
